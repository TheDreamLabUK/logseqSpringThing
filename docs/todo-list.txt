In the dispose method, add error handling to each component's disposal logic. Log any errors that occur during disposal.

412. Connection Status

File: index.ts

Task: Handle the case where the connection status element is not found.

Instructions:

In the updateConnectionStatus method, check if the connection status element exists before updating it.

413. Settings Update

File: handlers/settings/visualization.rs

Task: Save the updated settings to a file.

Instructions:

Create a function save_settings_to_file that serializes the Settings object to a TOML string and writes it to the settings file.

Call this function in the update_setting_value function after updating the in-memory settings.

414. Settings Initialization

File: state/settings.ts

Task: Handle the case where all retries fail.

Instructions:

In the initialize method, if all retries fail, log an error and use the default settings.

415. Settings Subscription

File: state/settings.ts

Task: Handle the case where the setting path is invalid.

Instructions:

In the subscribe method, validate the setting path and throw an error if it's invalid.

416. Settings Update

File: state/settings.ts

Task: Validate the setting value before updating it.

Instructions:

In the updateSetting method, validate the setting value before updating it.

417. Settings Access

File: state/settings.ts

Task: Return a more specific error type from get.

Instructions:

Define a custom error type that represents the possible errors that can occur when getting a setting.

418. Settings Category

File: state/settings.ts

Task: Avoid copying the category settings in getCategory.

Instructions:

Return a reference to the category settings instead of a copy.

419. Settings Batch Update

File: state/settings.ts

Task: Handle the case where one of the updates fails.

Instructions:

In the batchUpdate method, handle errors returned by updateSetting and either roll back the changes or return an error.

420. Settings Disposal

File: state/settings.ts

Task: Clear the settings object in dispose.

Instructions:

In the dispose method, clear the settings object.

421. Settings Store Initialization

File: state/SettingsStore.ts

Task: Handle the case where the setting path is invalid.

Instructions:

In the subscribe method, validate the setting path and throw an error if it's invalid.

In the dispose method, clear the subscribers and any other resources.

425. Settings Loading

File: websocket/websocketService.ts

Instructions:

In the loadWebSocketSettings method, handle the case where the settings endpoint returns an error. Log the error and use default settings if necessary.

426. Settings Update

File: handlers/settings/websocket.rs

Task: Validate the setting value before updating it.

Instructions:

In the update_websocket_settings handler, validate the setting value before updating it. Check if the update_rate is within acceptable limits (e.g., between 1 and 120).

427. Settings Serialization

File: handlers/settings/common.rs

Task: Optimize settings serialization and deserialization.

Instructions:

Consider using a more efficient serialization format, such as bincode or MessagePack, instead of JSON. These formats are generally faster and produce smaller output.

Reduce the number of serialization/deserialization steps. For example, you could serialize the entire settings object once instead of serializing each category individually.

428. Case Conversion

File: utils/case_conversion.rs

Task: Optimize case conversion functions.

Instructions:

Consider using a more efficient method for case conversion, such as a lookup table or a specialized library, instead of regular expressions.

429. Settings Response Type

Task: Return a more specific error type from get_category_settings_value.

Instructions:

Use the custom error type defined in step 429.
