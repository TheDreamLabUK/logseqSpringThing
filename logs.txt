High Priority (Data Population but No Rendering)

Verify Data Integrity (Junior): Confirm that the graphData received from the WebSocket actually contains valid node and edge data. Check for:

graphData not being null or undefined.

nodes and edges arrays being populated and containing the expected data structure (id, position, source, target, etc.).

Log or inspect a sample of nodes and edges, including their positions, to ensure they have reasonable values. Pay close attention to the scale of the positions, as they are scaled by POSITION_SCALE on the client-side. If positions are all very small, this could explain the lack of rendering.

Verify that the metadata object is correctly populated and contains valid data for each node.

Check for any console errors related to data parsing or validation.

Inspect Three.js Scene (Senior): Investigate the Three.js scene setup to identify potential rendering issues. Check for:

Scene, camera, and renderer being correctly initialized and added to the DOM.

Graph nodes and edges being added to the scene graph. Verify that the graphGroup, nodesGroup, and edgesGroup are added to the scene.

Camera position and target being set appropriately to view the graph. If the camera is too far away or looking in the wrong direction, the graph might not be visible. Try manually adjusting the camera position in the browser's developer tools to see if the graph appears.

Correct scaling of node positions. Node positions received from the server are scaled by POSITION_SCALE. Ensure this scaling is correctly applied when setting the node positions in Three.js.

Check for any console errors related to Three.js or WebGL.

Component Hierarchy and Rendering (Senior):

Ensure the GraphSystem component is correctly mounted and rendered within the App component.

Verify that the graphData prop is passed correctly to the GraphSystem component.

Check that the isReady computed property in GraphSystem correctly reflects the initialization state of the Three.js scene. The graph should only be rendered when isReady is true.

Inspect the BaseVisualization component to ensure it's correctly rendering the scene, camera, and graph system.

Verify the updateVisualization method in BaseVisualization is called with the correct data and that the graphData prop is updated.

Force Graph Update and Rendering (Senior):

Examine the useForceGraph composable and its updateGraph, updateNodes, and updateLinks methods. Ensure these methods are called correctly when new graph data is received or when binary position updates are received.

Verify that the instanced meshes are correctly updated with the new node and link positions. Check that the count property of the instanced meshes is set correctly and that the instanceMatrix and instanceColor attributes are updated.

Inspect the rendering logic in useForceGraph to ensure the nodes and links are being rendered correctly.

Binary Update Handling (Senior):

Review the binary update handling logic in websocketService.ts and binaryUpdate.ts. Ensure the binary data is correctly parsed and that the positions and velocities are extracted.

Verify that the updateFromBinary action in binaryUpdate.ts correctly updates the store state.

Check that the changedNodes set is populated correctly and that the updatePositions method in useVisualization.ts is called with the correct data.

Confirm that the binary updates are being sent and received correctly over the WebSocket. Enable binary debug logging (ENABLE_BINARY_DEBUG) to inspect the binary data being sent and received.

Check for any console errors related to binary data handling.

Medium Priority (Inefficiencies and Upgrades)

Optimize Force-Directed Layout: The CPU-based force-directed layout implementation in visualization/layout.js can be optimized. Consider using a more efficient algorithm or library like d3-force-3d for better performance.

Improve Node and Edge Rendering: The current rendering approach uses instanced meshes, which is a good start. However, further optimizations can be made, such as:

Level of Detail (LOD): Implement LOD for nodes and edges to reduce the number of rendered vertices at greater distances.

Frustum Culling: Implement frustum culling to avoid rendering nodes and edges outside the camera's view frustum.

Occlusion Culling: Consider occlusion culling techniques to further improve performance in dense graphs.

Optimize Label Rendering: The current label rendering approach creates a new sprite for each label. This can be inefficient for large graphs. Consider using a single instanced mesh for all labels or a more optimized text rendering library.

Refactor for Clarity: Some of the code, particularly in the visualization components and services, could benefit from refactoring for improved clarity and maintainability. Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable units.

Address prompt Error: The error message "Failed to load settings: missing field prompt" indicates a missing prompt field in your configuration. While you mention it's not currently used, it's best to fix this to avoid potential issues in the future. Ensure the prompt field is present in your settings.toml file or environment variables.

This detailed TODO list should help your team systematically address the rendering issue and improve the overall performance and maintainability of the graph visualization. Remember to thoroughly test each change and use browser developer tools to profile performance and identify bottlenecks.
