	- # Harvard Report
		- According to [recent research](https://www.pw.hks.harvard.edu/post/the-rapid-adoption-of-generative-ai) from Harvard and other institutions, generative AI has seen remarkably rapid adoption since its introduction:
			- ![889099_6bc1d69ec5284cc0a19315afe6075af0~mv2.webp](../assets/889099_6bc1d69ec5284cc0a19315afe6075af0~mv2_1728113404306_0.webp){:width 800}
			-
			- I did a whole lot of finger waving, guessing, integrating across "sauces", projecting, s-curve fitting, normalising, and lin/log swapsies. 
			  GenAI hitting higher user numbers than android handsets is likely a 2030 projection hype artefact, but not completely impossible if you assume genai on all Android handsets in some form by 2030. Take it all with a pinch of salt.
			  Bitcoin looks proper "drama" but it's possibly on a very compressed s-curve with a bend to the right sometime after 2030. Again, serious people are saying this, it's not just me, but that line especially is 'brittle'.
			  So, while this isn't exactly academic rigour, it IS inline with the citations across this page. It's a useful glance piece. These are just about the fastest tech adoptions in human history, in one place.

			- ## Key Findings
				- As of August 2024, 39.4% of Americans aged 18-64 reported using generative AI[1](https://www.aibase.com/news/11986)[2](https://www.pw.hks.harvard.edu/post/the-rapid-adoption-of-generative-ai).
				- 28% of employed respondents said they use generative AI at work[2](https://www.pw.hks.harvard.edu/post/the-rapid-adoption-of-generative-ai)[4](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2024/sep/rapid-adoption-generative-ai).
				- Nearly 1 in 9 workers (10.6%) reported using generative AI daily at work[3](https://forklightning.substack.com/p/the-rapid-adoption-of-generative).
				- Adoption has been faster than previous transformative technologies like personal computers and the internet[2](https://www.pw.hks.harvard.edu/post/the-rapid-adoption-of-generative-ai)[5](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/rapid-adoption-generative-ai).
				- ### Adoption Across Industries
					- Generative AI usage spans a wide range of occupations:
					- Over 40% adoption in management, business, and computing professions[1](https://www.aibase.com/news/11986).
					- 20% of "blue-collar" workers (e.g. construction, maintenance, transportation) use generative AI frequently at work[1](https://www.aibase.com/news/11986).
				- ### Common Use Cases
					- Workers employ generative AI for various tasks:
					- 57% use it for writing assistance
					- 49% use it for information searches
					- Other applications include summarizing reports and generating creative ideas[1](https://www.aibase.com/news/11986)
				- ### Potential Impact
					- Researchers estimate generative AI currently supports 0.5-3.5% of all work hours in the U.S.[2](https://www.pw.hks.harvard.edu/post/the-rapid-adoption-of-generative-ai)
					- This could potentially boost labor productivity by 0.125-0.875 percentage points, though this estimate is speculative[2](https://www.pw.hks.harvard.edu/post/the-rapid-adoption-of-generative-ai).
				- ### Factors Driving Rapid Adoption
					- The study suggests several reasons for generative AI's quick uptake:
					- Low cost and portability of tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini[1](https://www.aibase.com/news/11986)
					- Widespread access to computers and internet as a foundation[3](https://forklightning.substack.com/p/the-rapid-adoption-of-generative)
					- Broad applicability across many occupations and tasks[4](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2024/sep/rapid-adoption-generative-ai)
				- While adoption has been swift, researchers caution that the long-term economic impact will depend on how deeply generative AI becomes integrated into daily work processes over time[1](https://www.aibase.com/news/11986).

- # Ramp Report on AI Spending
	- [AI spending grew 293% last year. Here's how companies are using AI to stay ahead. (ramp.com)](https://ramp.com/blog/q1-2024-spending-insights)
	- **Increase in AI Spending:**
		- **375% Increase in AP Spend:** Accounts payable spending on AI vendors rose by 375% year-over-year in Q2.
		- **70.4% Retention Rate:** Companies that began spending on AI vendors in 2023 have a 70.4% retention rate after 12 months, compared to 42% for those starting in 2022.
		- **104% Increase in Card Spend:** Credit card spending on AI vendors doubled year-over-year, reflecting ongoing experimentation with AI tools.
	- **AI Vendor Adoption:**
		- **Anthropic's Growth:** Anthropic's market share surged from 4% to 177% in Q2 2024.
		- **Top AI Vendors:** Companies are increasingly purchasing from vendors like OpenAI, Anthropic, Grammarly, MidJourney, and 11 Labs, focusing on creative functions and foundational AI models.
	- **AI as a Key Productivity Tool:**
		- **Growth in AI Productivity Tools:** Tools such as Sunno AI, Limitless, Instantly, and Cursor are among the fastest-growing AI vendors, indicating widespread adoption for productivity enhancement.
	- ## Critical Analysis
		- **Anecdotal Evidence and Generalisation:**
			- The report is based on Ramp's customer data, which may not represent the broader market. Growth figures could be skewed by a few large companies or early adopters, making the data less generalisable.
			- The focus on rapidly growing vendors like Anthropic might overshadow the fact that many AI tools are still in experimental or early adoption stages.
		- **Superficial Engagement vs. Deep Integration:**
			- Increased spending may reflect experimentation rather than deep, sustainable integration of AI tools. Companies often try new tools without committing long-term.
			- Retention rates might indicate vendor lock-in rather than genuine satisfaction, as switching costs can deter companies from exploring better options.
		- **Economic and Market Dynamics:**
			- Spending increases may be driven by economic pressures to boost productivity without increasing headcount, rather than a belief in AI's transformative potential.
			- The surge in AI spending could be driven by hype, with companies adopting AI tools to keep up with competitors, regardless of their actual value.
		- **Sustainability of Growth:**
			- Rapid growth rates may not be sustainable. As the market matures, AI spending could slow as companies standardise on a few tools or find that efficiency gains do not meet expectations.
- ## The Gap
  id:: 659fe0be-a52a-42ef-8f50-73695a802945
	- McKinsey identified in 2022 that companies with a 5 year AI roadmap would likely pull ahead. [They called this "The Gap"](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2022-and-a-half-decade-in-review#gap)
	- Hindsight shows us that this was correct. Those companies feel somewhat unassailable, but the nature of the research publishing environment, and pace of progress, means there are plenty of opportunities.
	- ### Ways to close The Gap
		- [Daily Papers Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers)  << you can do worse than this to ambiently learn
- ## Custom Gen AI models in business

	- ### **DO play with tools**
		- Use the tools that come free with where you already keep your data.
		- Start to sort out your data. Learn it's structure, and whether it's useful to optimise it.
		- High quality data gives high quality outcomes.
		- Use the paid and private version of [RunDiffusion](https://app.rundiffusion.com/) to start to play with the open tooling. [[Fooocus]] is new and very accessible and on that platform with **everything** else of value.
		- See if there's something on the market that is trustable when your data and product are ready, don't spread data about too much.
		- Do check if this is worth it. Get an expert opinion. Bloomberg spent around $20M on a model based on their financial data only to find that GPT4 [still beats it](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05862.pdf).
		- Think about integrating the open tooling into your product development, consider the software licenses. Take **some** legal advice.
	- ### Avoid the [Secret Cyborg](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/reshaping-the-tree-rebuilding-organizations).
		- [twitter link to the render loading below](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1775176524653642164){{twitter https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1775176524653642164}}
		- Acknowledge that employees are already using AI at work, often without approval. Over half of people using AI at work are doing so without telling their bosses. [Microsoft put this number at a staggering 75%](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part/) [[Microsoft Work Trends Impact 2024]]
			- | Statistic | Value |
			  |-----------|-------|
			  | Percentage of global knowledge workers using generative AI | 75% |
			  | Percentage of AI users who say it helps them save time | 90% |
			  | Percentage of AI users who say it helps them focus on their most important work | 85% |
			  | Percentage of AI users who say it helps them be more creative | 84% |
			  | Percentage of AI users who say it helps them enjoy their work more | 83% |
			  | Percentage of AI users who are bringing their own AI tools to work (BYOAI) | 78% |
			  | Percentage of AI users at small and medium-sized companies who are bringing their own AI to work | 80% |
			  | Percentage of AI users reluctant to admit using AI for their most important tasks | 52% |
			  | Percentage of leaders who would rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them | 71% |
			  | Percentage of leaders who say early-in-career talent will be given greater responsibilities with AI | 77% |
		- Create a culture of exploration and openness around AI use. Encourage employees to share how they are using AI to assist their work.
		- Completely rethink and redesign work processes around AI capabilities, rather than just using AI to automate existing processes. Cut down the org chart and regrow it for AI.
		- Let teams develop their own methods for incorporating AI as an "intelligence" that adds to processes. Manage AI more like additional team members than external IT solutions.
		- Align incentives and provide clear guidelines so employees feel empowered to ethically experiment with AI.
		- Build for the rapidly evolving future of AI, not just today's models. Organizational change takes time, so consider future AI capabilities.
		- Act quickly
		- organizations that wait too long to experiment and adapt processes for AI efficiency gains will fall behind. Provide guidelines for short-term experimentation vs slow top-down solutions.
		- Realize there are only two ways to react to exponential AI change
		- too early or too late. The capabilities are increasing rapidly, so it's better to start adapting sooner than later.
