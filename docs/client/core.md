# Client Core Utilities and Hooks

This document describes the core utility functions and general-purpose React hooks used across the LogseqXR client application. These modules provide foundational functionalities that support various components and features.

## Core Utilities (`client/src/utils/`)

The `client/src/utils/` directory contains a collection of general-purpose utility functions designed for reusability and to encapsulate common logic.

### `logger.ts`

Provides a centralized logging mechanism for the client application. It allows for structured logging with different severity levels (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) and can be configured to control log output based on application settings.

**Key Features:**
-   **Level-based logging:** Filter messages based on their importance.
-   **Contextual logging:** Include additional data with log messages for better debugging.
-   **Conditional logging:** Enable/disable logging based on environment or debug flags.

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { createLogger } from '@/utils/logger'; // Assuming alias or direct path

const logger = createLogger('MyComponent');
logger.info('Application started successfully.');
logger.debug('Processing data:', { data: someObject });
logger.error('Failed to fetch graph data:', error);
```

### `binaryUtils.ts` ([`client/src/utils/binaryUtils.ts`](../../client/src/utils/binaryUtils.ts))

Contains helper functions for working with binary data, particularly useful for encoding and decoding messages transmitted over WebSockets using the custom binary protocol.

**Key Features:**
-   Functions for converting between `ArrayBuffer`, `Float32Array`, and other binary representations.
-   Utilities for reading and writing specific data types (e.g., floats, integers) from/to `ArrayBuffer` views.
-   `isZlibCompressed(data: ArrayBuffer): boolean`: Checks if the provided `ArrayBuffer` likely contains zlib compressed data (by looking for a zlib header).
-   `decompressZlib(compressedData: ArrayBuffer): Promise<ArrayBuffer>`: Decompresses zlib-compressed data using the browser's `DecompressionStream` API.

### `caseConversion.ts`

Provides utilities for converting string cases, such as `camelCase` to `snake_case` and vice-versa. This is often used when interacting with API endpoints or data structures that follow different naming conventions (e.g., JavaScript frontend using `camelCase` and Rust backend using `snake_case`).

**Key Functions:**
-   `camelToSnakeCase(str: string): string`
-   `snakeToCamelCase(str: string): string`

### `cn.ts`

A small utility for conditionally joining CSS class names, often used with Tailwind CSS to build dynamic class strings. It's a common pattern for managing component styling based on props or state.

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { cn } from '@/utils/cn'; // Assuming alias or direct path

const isActive = true;
const buttonClasses = cn('btn', isActive && 'btn-active', 'px-4');
// buttonClasses might be "btn btn-active px-4"
```

### `debugState.ts` ([`client/src/utils/debugState.ts`](../../client/src/utils/debugState.ts))

Provides utilities for managing and inspecting the application's debug state. This can include flags for enabling/disabling various debug visualizations, logging verbosity, or performance overlays.

**Key Features:**
-   Functions to set and retrieve debug flags (e.g., `isDebugEnabled('physics')`).
-   Loads and saves debug state from/to `localStorage` for persistence across sessions.
-   May integrate with the `SettingsStore` for more complex or UI-configurable debug settings.

### `deepMerge.ts`

A utility function for performing a deep merge of two or more objects. This is useful for combining default settings with user-specific overrides or for merging complex configuration objects.

**Key Features:**
-   Recursively merges properties of source objects into a target object.
-   Handles various data types, including arrays and nested objects.

### `objectPath.ts` ([`client/src/utils/objectPath.ts`](../../client/src/utils/objectPath.ts))

Provides functions for safely accessing, setting, or deleting values within nested JavaScript objects using a dot-separated path string (e.g., `'visualisation.nodes.size'`). This is particularly useful for interacting with the `SettingsStore` (via `settingsService.ts`) where settings are often identified and updated by their path.

**Key Functions:**
-   `get(obj: object, path: string, defaultValue?: any): any`
-   `set(obj: object, path: string, value: any): object`
-   `del(obj: object, path: string): object`

### `utils.ts`

A general-purpose utility file that might contain miscellaneous helper functions that don't fit into more specific categories. This could include array manipulation, string formatting, or other common operations.

## General-Purpose Hooks (`client/src/hooks/`)

The `client/src/hooks/` directory contains custom React hooks that provide reusable logic for common UI patterns or data management.

### `useContainerSize.ts` ([`client/src/hooks/useContainerSize.ts`](../../client/src/hooks/useContainerSize.ts))

A custom React hook that measures and provides the current dimensions (width and height) of a referenced DOM element. It typically uses `ResizeObserver` to react to changes in the element's size, making it useful for responsive layouts or sizing elements like the R3F canvas.

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { useContainerSize } from './useContainerSize';

function MyComponent() {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  const { width, height } = useContainerSize(ref);

  return (
    <div ref={ref} style={{ width: '100%', height: '500px' }}>
      Container size: {width}x{height}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### `useWindowSize.ts` ([`client/src/hooks/useWindowSize.ts`](../../client/src/hooks/useWindowSize.ts))

A custom React hook that provides the current dimensions (width and height) of the browser window. It updates reactively when the window is resized by listening to the `resize` event, enabling responsive design and layout adjustments based on the viewport size.

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { useWindowSize } from './useWindowSize';

function ResponsiveHeader() {
  const { width, height } = useWindowSize();
  const isMobile = width < 768;

  return (
    <header>
      {isMobile ? 'Mobile Header' : 'Desktop Header'}
      <p>Window size: {width}x{height}</p>
    </header>
  );
}
