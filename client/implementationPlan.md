# Implementation Plan

This new implementation should be best in class "mixed reality first" app structure, leaning heavily into the meta quest 3. The desktop interface remains important for managing settings through a clean TypeScript-based UI, while keeping the Meta Quest AR interface focused and uncluttered.

High-Level Goals:

Mixed Reality First, Desktop Second: ✓
- Optimal Meta Quest 3 experience
- Clean AR interface without control panels
- Desktop UI for settings management
- Unified codebase

Clean, Modern Architecture: ✓
- Pure TypeScript implementation
- Three.js for rendering
- No Vue.js dependencies
- Simple, efficient state management

Unified Settings Management: ✓
Settings are stored on the server in settings.toml. The desktop interface allows users to adjust these settings and save them back to the server. The Quest version reads and applies these same settings.
- ✓ Core settings types and interfaces
- ✓ Settings state management
- ✓ REST endpoints for settings (GET/PUT)
- ✓ Settings integration with rendering
- ✓ Desktop settings panel UI
- ✓ Settings persistence and save functionality

Graph Data Management: ✓
- Paginated graph loading for large datasets
- Efficient binary position updates
- Metadata handling and caching
- Edge case handling for disconnected nodes
- Optimized data structures for fast lookups

Network Architecture: ✓
- REST endpoints for settings and graph structure
  - Settings management via GET/PUT endpoints
  - Paginated graph loading
  - Metadata and relationship queries

- WebSocket for real-time updates ✓
  - Binary protocol for position updates
  - Settings broadcast to all clients
  - Simulation mode control
  - AR mode synchronization

- Data Flow Optimization ✓
  - Efficient binary serialization
  - Minimal payload sizes
  - Low-latency updates for AR
  - Error handling and recovery
